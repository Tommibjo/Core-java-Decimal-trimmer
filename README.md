# - Java code Snippets: Decimal trimmers -

# public static Object trim(double value):
After looking for a tenth time how to trim decimals for outputstream - I decided to make this in to it's own static method and save it for later use. This static method approves double values and returns integer or double (with two decimals) depending whether the value dividable with 1 or not.

# public static double round (double value, int precision)

Great method which I saved in to same class due it's usefulness. I've used this quite a few times in my school projects. 

Feel free to implement the code in your own projects, if you find it useful.
