## usage
All the credits for this goes to jpdymond @ stackoverflow ( https://stackoverflow.com/users/2984077/jpdymond ).
Great method which I saved in to same class due it's usefulness. I've used this quite a few times in my school projects. 

Feel free to implement the code in your own projects, if you find it useful.
