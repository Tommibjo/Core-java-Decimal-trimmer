# Java code Snippets: Decimal trimmer

After looking for a tenth time how to trim decimals for outputstream - I decided to make this in to it's own static method and save it for later use. This static method approves double values and returns integer or double (with trimmed decimals) depending whether the value dividable with 1 or not.

Feel free to implement the code, if you find it useful.
